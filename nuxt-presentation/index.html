      <h2>What is <a href="https://v3.nuxtjs.org/">NuxtJs?</a></h2>
      <p class="fragment fade-right"><i>Nuxt</i> is a progressive framework based on Vue.js to create modern web
        applications</p>
      <p class="fragment fade-up">

      <aside class="notes">
        <i>*Nuxt's</i> goal is to make web development intuitive and performant with a great developer experience in

      <h3>Why Nuxt?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li class="fragment fade-down">JavaScript framework - <b><i>Vue.js</i></b></li>
        <li class="fragment fade-left">Bundler - <b><i>webpack 5</i></b> or <b><i>Vite</i></b></li>
        <li class="fragment fade-right">Transpiler - <b><i>esbuild</i></b></li>
        <li class="fragment">Server - <b><i>h3</i></b></li>
        <li class="fragment fade-up">Routing library - <b><i>vue-router</i></b></li>
      </ol>

      <aside class="notes">
        To understand what Nuxt is, we need to understand what we need to create a modern application
        <br>*1) JavaScript framework to bring reactivity and web components, Nuxt works in Vue.js
        <br>*2) Bundler to support hot module replacement in development and bundle your code for production, Nuxt
        support
        both webpack 5 and Vite
        <br>*3) Transpiler to write the latest JavaScript syntax while supporting legacy browsers, Nuxt use esbuild for
        that
        <br>*4) Server for serving your application in development, but also to support server-side rendering or API
        routes,
        Nuxt uses h3 for deployment
        <br>*5) Routing library to handle client-side navigation, Nuxt chose vue-router

      <h3>Nuxt directory</h3>
      <p class="fragment"><i>Nuxt</i> uses the <b><i>.nuxt/</i></b> directory in development to generate your Vue
        application
      </p>

      <aside class="notes">
        *Nuxt provides a directory structure to follow, focused on specific features to keep your focus on creating, not
        configuring

        <li class="fragment fade-down">Core Engine: <b><i>nuxt</i></b></li>
        <li class="fragment fade-right">Bundlers: <b><i>@nuxt/vite-builder</i></b> and

      <h3>Are you Nuxt?</h3>
      <p class="fragment fade-down"><i>Nuxt</i> is the backbone of your Vue.js project, giving structure to build your
        project
        with confidence while keeping flexibility</p>

      <aside class="notes">
        *Extendable with a strong module ecosystem and hooks engine, it makes it easy to connect your REST or GraphQL
        endpoints, favorite CMS, CSS frameworks and more. PWA and AMP support is only a module away from your Nuxt
        project.

      <h3>Vue.js Development</h3>
      <p class="fragment fade-left"><i>Nuxt</i> uses Vue as a frontend framework and adds features such as component
        auto-imports and file-based routing</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Components auto-imports</h3>
      <p class="fragment">Every Vue component created in the <b><i>components/</i></b> directory of a <i>Nuxt</i>
        project will
        be available in your project without having to import it. If a component is not used anywhere, your productionâ€™s
        code will not include it</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Vue Router</h3>
      <p class="fragment">Most applications need multiple pages and a way to navigate between them. This is called
        routing. <i>Nuxt</i> uses a <b><i>pages/</i></b> directory and naming conventions to directly create routes
        mapped to
        your files
        using the official Vue Router library</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Developers chose to build Nuxt on top of Vue for these reasons:</h3>
      <ol class="font-size-34">
        <li class="fragment fade-left">The reactivity model of Vue, where a change in data automatically triggers a
          change in the
          interface
        </li>
        <li class="fragment fade-right">The component-based templating, while keeping HTML as the common language of the
          web,
          enables intuitive patterns to keep your interface consistent, yet powerful
        </li>
        <li class="fragment fade-up">From small projects to large web applications, Vue keeps performing well at scale
          to ensure
          that your application keeps delivering value to your users

      <h3>Rendering Modes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li class="fragment fade-left">client-side</li>
        <li class="fragment fade-right">universal</li>
      </ul>

      <aside class="notes">Both the browser and server can interpret JavaScript code to render Vue.js components into
        HTML elements. This step is called rendering. Nuxt supports both *client-side and *universal rendering.
      </aside>

    <section>
      <h3>Client-side only rendering</h3>
      <p class="fragment fade-up">
        <img src="./assets/client-side-rendering.a1fb1a89.svg" alt="client-side rendering">
      </p>

      <aside class="notes">Out of the box, a traditional Vue.js application is rendered in the browser (or client).
        Then, Vue.js generates HTML elements after the browser downloads and parses all the JavaScript code containing
        the instructions to create the current interface.
      </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Universal Rendering</h3>
      <p class="fragment fade-up">
        <img src="./assets/universal-rendering.7db0a5cb.svg" alt="universal rendering">
      </p>

      <aside class="notes">
        When the browser requests a URL with universal (client-side + server-side) rendering enabled, the server returns
        a fully rendered HTML page to the browser. Whether the page has been generated in advance and cached or is
        rendered on the fly, at some point, Nuxt has run the JavaScript (Vue.js) code in a server environment, producing
        an HTML document. Users immediately get the content of our application, contrary to client-side rendering. This
        step is similar to traditional server-side rendering performed by PHP or Ruby applications.
        <br>To not lose the benefits of the client-side rendering method, such as dynamic interfaces and pages
        transitions,
        the Client loads the javascript code that runs on the Server in the background once the HTML document has been
        downloaded. The browser interprets it again (hence Universal rendering) and Vue.js takes control of the document
        and enables interactivity.
        <br>Making a static page interactive in the browser is called "Hydration."
        <br>Universal rendering allows a Nuxt application to provide quick page load times while preserving the benefits
        of
        client-side rendering. Furthermore, as the content is already present in the HTML document, crawlers can index
        it without overhead.

      <h3>Coming in Nuxt 3</h3>
      <ul>
        <li class="fragment fade-left">Hybrid Rendering</li>
        <li class="fragment fade-right">Rendering on CDN edge workers</li>
      </ul>

      <aside class="notes">
        In most cases, universal rendering as performed in Nuxt 2 offers a good user and developer experience. However,
        Nuxt 3 takes universal rendering a step further by introducing *hybrid rendering and edge-side rendering.
        <br>Hybrid rendering allows different caching rules per route and decides how the Server should respond to a new
        request on a given URL.
        <br>At the moment, every page (or route) of a Nuxt application must use the same rendering mode, client-side or
        universal. But in various cases, some pages could be generated at build time, while others should be client-side
        rendered. For example, think of a content website with an admin section. Every content page should be primarily
        static and generated once, but the admin section requires registration and behaves more like a dynamic
        application.
        <br>Traditionally, server-side and universal rendering was only possible using Node.js. Nuxt 3 takes it to
        another
        level by directly rendering code in *CDN edge workers, reducing latency and costs.
        <br>Nitro is the new server engine that powers Nuxt 3. It offers cross-platform support for Node.js, Deno,
        Workers,
        and more. Nitro's design is platform-agnostic and allows rendering a Nuxt application at the edge, closer to
        your users, allowing replication and further optimizations.
